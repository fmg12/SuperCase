  abstract = {Electrical resistivity measurements have been made under nearly hydrostatic pressure up to 18 kbar and at temperatures between 50 mK and room temperature on polycrystalline specimens of the ferromagnetic compound UGe2. The Curie temperature decreases monotonically with pressure and can no longer be identified from the electrical resistivity measurements at a critical pressure Pc 16 kbar. Plots of d{$\rho$}/dT versus T reveal a feature in the {$\rho$}(T ) curves at T0 {$\sim$} 0.6TC at P = 0 kbar that decreases monotonically with pressure and appears to vanish near Pc. The onset of superconductivity is observed in the range 8 kbar {$<$} P {$<$} 14 kbar with a maximum onset temperature of 1.2 K at P {$\sim$} 13 kbar. The polycrystalline specimens have a residual resistivity {$\rho$}0 up to {$\sim$}3 \textmu{} cm corresponding to an electron mean free path smaller than or of the order of the superconducting coherence length. These results suggest that high-purity specimens with long mean free paths are not necessary, at least in the case of UGe2, in order to observe superconductivity near the critical pressure where the magnetic ordering temperature vanishes.},

  abstract = {The highest critical temperature of superconductivity Tc has been achieved in cuprates: 133 K at ambient pressure and 164 K at high pressures. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not disclosed, the prospects for a higher Tc are not clear. In contrast the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory gives a clear guide for achieving high Tc: it should be a favorable combination of high frequency phonons, strong coupling between electrons and phonons, and high density of states. These conditions can be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent hydrogen dominant compounds. Numerous followed calculations supported this idea and predicted Tc=100-235 K for many hydrides but only moderate Tc\textasciitilde 17 K has been observed experimentally. Here we found that sulfur hydride transforms at P\textasciitilde 90 GPa to metal and superconductor with Tc increasing with pressure to 150 K at \textasciitilde 200 GPa. This is in general agreement with recent calculations of Tc\textasciitilde 80 K for H2S. Moreover we found superconductivity with Tc\textasciitilde 190 K in a H2S sample pressurized to P{$>$}150 GPa at T{$>$}220 K. This superconductivity likely associates with the dissociation of H2S, and formation of SHn (n{$>$}2) hydrides. We proved occurrence of superconductivity by the drop of the resistivity at least 50 times lower than the copper resistivity, the decrease of Tc with magnetic field, and the strong isotope shift of Tc in D2S which evidences a major role of phonons in the superconductivity. H2S is a substance with a moderate content of hydrogen therefore high Tc can be expected in a wide range of hydrogen-contain materials. Hydrogen atoms seem to be essential to provide the high frequency modes in the phonon spectrum and the strong electron-phonon coupling.},

  abstract = {Significance                            In metals, identical Fermions in three dimensions invariably form a Fermi liquid or superconducting state at low temperature, except at quantum critical points separating differently ordered states. We report that uranium diauride (UAu               2               ) breaks this paradigm, hosting a robust non-Fermi liquid within a magnetically ordered state. Non-Fermi liquid behavior untethered from a quantum critical point in a clean metal has only clearly been seen in the magnetically partial-ordered phase of MnSi at high pressure and the potential quantum critical phase of magnetically unordered               {$\beta$}               -YbAlB               4               . Unlike MnSi and               {$\beta$}               -YbAlB               4               , UAu               2               is magnetically ordered, so the mechanism in this case is different, suggesting such states may exist more widely. An accompanying charge density wave suggests this mechanism may involve charge degrees of freedom.                        ,                             The term Fermi liquid is almost synonymous with the metallic state. The association is known to break down at quantum critical points (QCPs), but these require precise values of tuning parameters, such as pressure and applied magnetic field, to exactly suppress a continuous phase transition temperature to the absolute zero. Three-dimensional non-Fermi liquid states, apart from superconductivity, that are unshackled from a QCP are much rarer and are not currently well understood. Here, we report that the triangular lattice system uranium diauride (UAu               2               ) forms such a state with a non-Fermi liquid low-temperature heat capacity                                                                        C                     /                     T                     {$\sim$}                     log                     {$\mkern1mu$}                     (                     1                     /                     T                     )                                                                  and electrical resistivity                                                                        {$\rho$}                     (                     T                     )                     -                     {$\rho$}                     (                     0                     )                     {$\propto$}                                            T                                                1.35                                                                                                              far below its N\'eel temperature. The magnetic order itself has a novel structure and is accompanied by weak charge modulation that is not simply due to magnetostriction. The charge modulation continues to grow in amplitude with decreasing temperature, suggesting that charge degrees of freedom play an important role in the non-Fermi liquid behavior. In contrast with QCPs, the heat capacity and resistivity we find are unusually resilient in magnetic field. Our results suggest that a combination of magnetic frustration and Kondo physics may result in the emergence of this novel state.},

The antiferromagnetic state hosts a marginal fermi liquid and the pressure evolution of the resistivity within this state is found to be very different from that approaching a standard quantum phase transition. The superconductivity that appears above this transition survives in high magnetic fields with a large critical field for all field directions. The critical field also has an unusual angle dependence suggesting that the superconductivity may have an order parameter with multiple components. An order parameter consistent with these observations is predicted to host half-quantum vortices (HQVs). Such vortices can be topologically entangled and have potential applications in quantum computing.},
