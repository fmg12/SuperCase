  abstract = {We report the first observation of the de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) effect in the novel spin-triplet superconductor UTe2 using high quality single crystals with the high residual resistivity ratio (RRR) over 200. The dHvA frequencies, named alpha and beta, are detected for the field directions between c and a-axes. The frequency of branch beta increases rapidly with the field angle tilted from c to a-axis, while branch alpha splits, owing to the maximal and minimal cross-sectional areas from the same Fermi surface. Both dHvA branches, alpha and beta reveal two kinds of cylindrical Fermi surfaces with a strong corrugation at least for branch alpha. The angular dependence of the dHvA frequencies is in very good agreement with that calculated by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) method taking into account the on-site Coulomb repulsion of U = 2 eV, indicating the main Fermi surfaces are experimentally detected. The detected cyclotron effective masses are large in the range from 32 to 57 m0 . They are approximately 10-20 times lager than the corresponding band masses, consistent with the mass enhancement obtained from the Sommerfeld coefficient and the calculated density of states at the Fermi level. The local density approximation (LDA) calculations of ThTe2 assuming U4+ with the 5f\^2 localized model are in less agreement with our experimental results, in spite of the prediction for two cylindrical Fermi surfaces, suggesting a mixed valence states of U4+ and U3+ in UTe2.},

  abstract = {Electrical resistivity measurements have been made under nearly hydrostatic pressure up to 18 kbar and at temperatures between 50 mK and room temperature on polycrystalline specimens of the ferromagnetic compound UGe2. The Curie temperature decreases monotonically with pressure and can no longer be identified from the electrical resistivity measurements at a critical pressure Pc 16 kbar. Plots of d{$\rho$}/dT versus T reveal a feature in the {$\rho$}(T ) curves at T0 {$\sim$} 0.6TC at P = 0 kbar that decreases monotonically with pressure and appears to vanish near Pc. The onset of superconductivity is observed in the range 8 kbar {$<$} P {$<$} 14 kbar with a maximum onset temperature of 1.2 K at P {$\sim$} 13 kbar. The polycrystalline specimens have a residual resistivity {$\rho$}0 up to {$\sim$}3 \textmu{} cm corresponding to an electron mean free path smaller than or of the order of the superconducting coherence length. These results suggest that high-purity specimens with long mean free paths are not necessary, at least in the case of UGe2, in order to observe superconductivity near the critical pressure where the magnetic ordering temperature vanishes.},

We show how the normal state properties can be consistently and quantitatively explained in terms of Landau quasi-particles moving on a quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surface. Besides presenting our full and extensive data sets, we explain the details of some novel data analysis tools that can be used within the general context of quasi-two-dimensional metals. We then use the experimental Fermi surface and band dispersion to reassess several issues relevant to the unconventional superconductivity in Sr2RuO4, such as the spin-fluctuation spectrum, quasi-particle renormalization, interlayer dispersion and pressure dependence.},

  abstract = {The highest critical temperature of superconductivity Tc has been achieved in cuprates: 133 K at ambient pressure and 164 K at high pressures. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not disclosed, the prospects for a higher Tc are not clear. In contrast the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory gives a clear guide for achieving high Tc: it should be a favorable combination of high frequency phonons, strong coupling between electrons and phonons, and high density of states. These conditions can be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent hydrogen dominant compounds. Numerous followed calculations supported this idea and predicted Tc=100-235 K for many hydrides but only moderate Tc\textasciitilde 17 K has been observed experimentally. Here we found that sulfur hydride transforms at P\textasciitilde 90 GPa to metal and superconductor with Tc increasing with pressure to 150 K at \textasciitilde 200 GPa. This is in general agreement with recent calculations of Tc\textasciitilde 80 K for H2S. Moreover we found superconductivity with Tc\textasciitilde 190 K in a H2S sample pressurized to P{$>$}150 GPa at T{$>$}220 K. This superconductivity likely associates with the dissociation of H2S, and formation of SHn (n{$>$}2) hydrides. We proved occurrence of superconductivity by the drop of the resistivity at least 50 times lower than the copper resistivity, the decrease of Tc with magnetic field, and the strong isotope shift of Tc in D2S which evidences a major role of phonons in the superconductivity. H2S is a substance with a moderate content of hydrogen therefore high Tc can be expected in a wide range of hydrogen-contain materials. Hydrogen atoms seem to be essential to provide the high frequency modes in the phonon spectrum and the strong electron-phonon coupling.},

  abstract = {Despite intense experimental efforts, the nature of the unconventional superconducting order parameter of UTe\$\_2\$ remains elusive. This puzzle stems from different reported numbers of superconducting transitions at ambient pressure, as well as a complex pressure-temperature phase diagram. To bring new insights into the superconducting properties of UTe\$\_2\$, we measured the heat capacity and electrical resistivity of single crystals under compressive uniaxial stress \$\textbackslash sigma\$ applied along different crystallographic directions. We find that the critical temperature \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm c\}\$ of the single observed bulk superconducting transition decreases with \$\textbackslash sigma\$ along \$[100]\$ and \$[110]\$ but increases with \$\textbackslash sigma\$ along \$[001]\$. Aside from its effect on \$T\_\{\textbackslash rm c\}\$, we notice that \$c\$-axis stress leads to a significant piezoresistivity, which we associate with the shift of the zero-pressure resistivity peak at \$T\^\textbackslash star \textbackslash approx 15\textbackslash, \textbackslash rm K\$ to lower temperatures under stress. Finally, we show that an in-plane shear stress \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{xy\}\$ does not induce any observable splitting of the superconducting transition over a stress range of \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{xy\}\textbackslash approx 0.17 \textbackslash, \textbackslash rm GPa\$. This result suggests that the superconducting order parameter of UTe\$\_2\$ may be single-component at ambient pressure.},

  abstract = {The search for a material platform for topological quantum computation has recently focused on unconventional superconductors. Such material systems, where the superconducting order parameter breaks a symmetry of the crystal point group, are capable of hosting novel phenomena, including emergent Majorana quasiparticles. Unique among unconventional superconductors is the recently discovered UTe2, where spin-triplet superconductivity emerges from a paramagnetic normal state. Although UTe2 could be considered a relative of a family of known ferromagnetic superconductors, the unique crystal structure of this material and experimentally suggested zero Curie temperature pose a great challenge to determining the symmetries, magnetism, and topology underlying the superconducting state. These emergent properties will determine the utility of UTe2 for future spintronics and quantum information applications. Here, we report observations of a non-zero polar Kerr effect and of two transitions in the specific heat upon entering the superconducting state, which together show that the superconductivity in UTe2 is characterized by an order parameter with two components that breaks time reversal symmetry. These data allow us to place firm constraints on the symmetries of the order parameter, which strongly suggest that UTe2 is a Weyl superconductor that hosts chiral Fermi arc surface states.},

Non-Fermi liquid behavior untethered from a quantum critical point in a clean metal has only clearly been seen in the magnetically partial-ordered phase of MnSi at high pressure and the potential quantum critical phase of magnetically unordered               {$\beta$}               -YbAlB               4               . Unlike MnSi and               {$\beta$}               -YbAlB               4               , UAu               2               is magnetically ordered, so the mechanism in this case is different, suggesting such states may exist more widely. An accompanying charge density wave suggests this mechanism may involve charge degrees of freedom.                        ,                             The term Fermi liquid is almost synonymous with the metallic state. The association is known to break down at quantum critical points (QCPs), but these require precise values of tuning parameters, such as pressure and applied magnetic field, to exactly suppress a continuous phase transition temperature to the absolute zero. Three-dimensional non-Fermi liquid states, apart from superconductivity, that are unshackled from a QCP are much rarer and are not currently well understood. Here, we report that the triangular lattice system uranium diauride (UAu               2               ) forms such a state with a non-Fermi liquid low-temperature heat capacity                                                                        C                     /                     T                     {$\sim$}                     log                     {$\mkern1mu$}                     (                     1                     /                     T                     )                                                                  and electrical resistivity                                                                        {$\rho$}                     (                     T                     )                     -                     {$\rho$}                     (                     0                     )                     {$\propto$}                                            T                                                1.35                                                                                                              far below its N\'eel temperature. The magnetic order itself has a novel structure and is accompanied by weak charge modulation that is not simply due to magnetostriction. The charge modulation continues to grow in amplitude with decreasing temperature, suggesting that charge degrees of freedom play an important role in the non-Fermi liquid behavior. In contrast with QCPs, the heat capacity and resistivity we find are unusually resilient in magnetic field. Our results suggest that a combination of magnetic frustration and Kondo physics may result in the emergence of this novel state.},

The antiferromagnetic state hosts a marginal fermi liquid and the pressure evolution of the resistivity within this state is found to be very different from that approaching a standard quantum phase transition. The superconductivity that appears above this transition survives in high magnetic fields with a large critical field for all field directions. The critical field also has an unusual angle dependence suggesting that the superconductivity may have an order parameter with multiple components. An order parameter consistent with these observations is predicted to host half-quantum vortices (HQVs). Such vortices can be topologically entangled and have potential applications in quantum computing.},

  abstract = {An unusual superconductor                            In conventional, and in many unconventional, superconductors, the electrons that form Cooper pairs have spins pointing in opposite directions. An applied magnetic field can easily ``break'' such pairs\textemdash and destroy superconductivity\textemdash by aligning both spins in the same direction. In contrast, spin-triplet superconductors are much more resilient to magnetic fields. Very few candidates for such materials have been discovered. Ran               et al.               add to this select group by observing signatures of spin-triplet superconductivity, including a very large and anisotropic upper critical magnetic field, in the material UTe               2               . Because spin-triplet superconductors may naturally exhibit topological superconductivity, this material may also be of interest in quantum computing.                                         Science               , this issue p.               684                        ,                             Transport and nuclear magnetic resonance experiments indicate signatures of unconventional superconductivity in UTe               2               .                        ,                             Spin-triplet superconductors potentially host topological excitations that are of interest for quantum information processing. We report the discovery of spin-triplet superconductivity in UTe               2               , featuring a transition temperature of 1.6 kelvin and a very large and anisotropic upper critical field exceeding 40 teslas. This superconducting phase stability suggests that UTe               2               is related to ferromagnetic superconductors such as UGe               2               , URhGe, and UCoGe. However, the lack of magnetic order and the observation of quantum critical scaling place UTe               2               at the paramagnetic end of this ferromagnetic superconductor series. A large intrinsic zero-temperature reservoir of ungapped fermions indicates a highly unconventional type of superconducting pairing.},

It is shown that features observed previously at temperatures of about 0.5 K in magnetic fields between about 29 and 30 T in the magnetoresistance, Hall coefficient and ultrasound velocity are associated with quantum oscillations, which are clearly seen at lower temperatures. A hysteresis observed at 40 mK for all three steps of the metamagnetic transition confirms that they all are first order transitions.},

  abstract = {UTe\$\_2\$ is a promising spin-triplet superconductor candidate for which high quality samples with long mean free paths have recently become available, thereby enabling quantum oscillation measurements to probe the Fermi surface of this material. The dimensionality of Fermi surface sections of a triplet superconductor can have important implications regarding the topological properties of the superconductivity. For example, UTe\$\_2\$ has been proposed to possess a chiral superconducting order parameter, which could result in the formation of topologically protected Majorana surface states. Here, we report the observation of oscillatory components in the magnetoconductance of UTe\$\_2\$ at high magnetic fields. We find that these oscillations are very well described by quantum interference between quasiparticles traversing semiclassical trajectories spanning magnetic breakdown networks. Our observations are fully consistent with a quasi-2D model of this material's Fermi surface based on prior dHvA-effect measurements. Our results indicate that UTe\$\_2\$ -- which exhibits incredibly complex physical properties -- possesses a remarkably simple Fermi surface consisting exclusively of two quasi-2D cylindrical sections.},

  abstract = {The spin-triplet superconductor UTe\$\_2\$ exhibits a myriad of exotic physical phenomena, including the possession of three distinct superconducting phases at ambient pressure for magnetic field \$\textbackslash mu\_0 H \textbackslash leq\$ 40\textasciitilde T aligned in certain orientations. However, contradictory reports between studies performed on UTe\$\_2\$ specimens of varying quality have severely impeded theoretical efforts to understand the microscopic properties of this material. Here, we report high magnetic field measurements on a new generation of ultraclean UTe\$\_2\$ crystals grown by a salt flux technique, which possess enhanced superconducting critical temperatures and fields compared to previous sample generations. Remarkably, for \$H\$ applied close to the hard magnetic \$b\$ direction, we find that the angular extent of magnetic field-reinforced superconductivity is significantly increased in these pristine quality crystals. This suggests that in close proximity to a field-induced metamagnetic transition the enhanced role of magnetic fluctuations - that are strongly suppressed by disorder - is likely responsible for tuning UTe\$\_2\$ between two distinct spin-triplet superconducting phases. Our results reveal a strong sensitivity to crystalline disorder of the field-reinforced superconducting state of UTe\$\_2\$.},
