\subsection*{Superconductivity resurgent}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
  \item Large volume applications
  \item Fundamentals
  \item Materials breakthroughs
\end{itemize}

One of the most exciting recent developments in condensed matter research has been the
demonstration of \myul{superconductivity in superhydrides} near room temperature but at very high pressure
\cite{snider20,drozdov19,somayazulu19}. 
The compressed superhydrides demonstrate the power of engineering a phonon-mediated superconducting pairing mechanism towards optimal outcomes. Further gains are possible by widening the scope towards 
%In compressed superhydrides such as LaH\textsubscript{10}, superconductivity is mediated by dynamic deformations of
%the crystal lattice which, because of the light mass of the hydrogen
%atoms and the high spring constants caused by strong compression, reach
%to very high frequencies. This approach could produce
%high temperature superconductivity at ambient pressure, if -- like diamond -- a metastable high pressure structure could be brought back to ambient conditions. %This is not the case for LaH$_{10}$. 
\emph{unconventional superconductors}, which harness the \myul{strong electronic
interactions} that are also responsible for magnetism and that are
known in some cases to reach coupling strengths equivalent to several
thousand Kelvin. %Unconventional superconductivity in cuprates, for instance, has already produced transition temperatures $T_c$ approaching $160~\text{K}$. To optimise the effects of direct
% electronic interactions further requires a better understanding of the underlying and often competing
% mechanisms in these complex materials. 
%Medium-term commercial impact will arise from new materials identified as a consequence of our research. Our experimental results will help refine numerical models that will guide the search for new superconductors with high volume applications, including those mentioned in the introduction above. 




Only a few material families are so far known to exhibit superconductivity
that is not mediated by lattice deformations, or phonons, alone \cite{monthoux07,norman11}. Like rare minerals that occur in seams, these superconductors are thinly spread across the space of all accessible materials but richly concentrated within those families on which most current research is focused.
%and our group has played a leading role in discovering several such examples \cite{mathur98,saxena00,grosche00,zou14}.
We urgently need to find new unconventional superconductors: 
%they present proving grounds for advanced computational techniques, generate fresh impulses that advance our understanding of superconducting quantum materials in general and thereby prepare the ground for the next discovery,  helping us formulate guiding principles -- heuristic filters needed to select promising candidate systems. 
not only are they scientifically interesting -- with every case  studied, the guiding principles for finding new superconducting material families can be refined.
An example of such a guiding principle is illustrated in \autoref{fig:Guiding}, namely to home in on the threshold of magnetic order. There, at a so-called  \myul{quantum phase transition}, magnetic excitations reach to low energies. They mediate a long-ranged interaction which can stabilise superconductivity with an unconventional order parameter structure %(e.g. $s_\pm$, $p$- or $d$-wave)  
\cite{monthoux07}. Such non-phononic pairing interactions are strongly tuneable. This causes superconducting domes 
%as in Fig.~{\ref{fig:Guiding} 
which in some cases are surprisingly narrow, explaining why this type of superconductivity is often found not by random searches but by scanning phase diagrams systematically near the border of magnetism. % -- for which high pressure studies are well suited.

  \caption{{\bf Template phase diagrams guiding materials exploration:}  (a) High pressure phase diagram of CePd$_2$Si$_2$, showing a superconducting region attached to the

  in UGe$_2$ (b), 
  superconductivity appears within a ferromagnetic region, which itself branches into two metamagnetic sheets \protect\cite{kotegawa11}. In PrPtAl or NbFe$_2$ \protect\citesel{friedemann18} (c), by contrast, ferromagnetism is replaced by an antiferromagnetic or spin-density wave region.
  %With hindsight, the  observation that iron-based superconductivity often peaks near the disappearance of magnetic order, whether achieved
  %by doping or pressure, resonates with the earlier realisation that low-\emph{T}\textsubscript{c} Ce-based
  %superconductors are frequently found on the threshold of magnetism.

\paragraph{Uranium-based superconductors} make up a large fraction of the overall still limited number of unconventional superconductors (Table). Moreover, this material family is highly diverse in terms of crystal and electronic structure. Superconductivity in U compounds is often found near the threshold of ferromagnetism, but many U superconductors are antiferromagnetic or appear far from the threshold of magnetism. 



%The discovery of new unconventional superconductors often appears to happen randomly, although with hindsight some may have been anticipated. 
%The searches that led to these discoveries were guided by theoretical principles, most prominently the exploration of quantum phase transitions. The success of these searches suggests that the time may be right for a systematic programme of exploration (\autoref{Prospecting}),


%Importantly, however, %things are not usually as clean-cut as suggested by \autoref{fig:Guiding}, and 
\paragraph{.}

   \caption{{\bf Material families} identified for this project, which combine an anomalous normal state %(non-Fermi liquid power-law dependence of the electrical resistivity on temperature) 
   with unconventional or strong-coupling superconductivity. The choice of materials is motivated by our recent discoveries of unconventional superconductivity in YFe$_2$Ge$_2$, LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$ and high pressure CeSb$_2$, the realisation of the importance of sliding modes in incommensurate host guest phases such as high pressure Bi \protect\citesel{brown18} and Sb,  progress in crystal growth, which has for the first time  produced high quality crystals of the unconventional superconductor CeNi$_2$Ge$_2$, and advances in high pressure techniques. }%, required for all four systems.}% and it offers the opportunity to study the interplay between strong correlations and the superconducting state across a wide range of electronic energy scales.}
   %(a) the new iron-based superconductor YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ (paramagnetic) and its isoelectronic sister material LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$ (antiferromagnetic below about $\SI{8}{\kelvin}$) sit on either side of a magnetic quantum critical point.

(c) CeSb$_2$ undergoes a structural transition under pressure into a new structure that displays strikingly low electronic energy scale, corresponding to a record density of states enhancement among Ce compounds. Superconductivity, just recently discovered by the Cambridge group, is surprisingly robust to magnetic field, and the reentrant nature of the critical field curve (arrow) points towards a field tuned magnetic quantum critical point. (d) Bi, Sb, Ba and a number of other elements transition into an incommensurate host-guest structure at high pressure, in which strong-coupling superconductivity and anomalous normal state properties (linear $T$-dependence of the resistivity) can be attributed to an in-built low energy sliding mode.}

\end{figure}

\paragraph{Clean crystals for a clearer view.} Long electronic mean free paths are required to establish anisotropic forms of order, such as unconventional superconductivity, and without high quality samples, such discoveries could easily be missed. After the initial discovery, informative investigation methods such as quantum oscillation measurements require high quality samples, and the availability of clean single crystals \myul{opens the door to external collaborations} (work package 2, below). And while the added complexity introduced by disorder itself produces interesting effects, this hinders the initial understanding of already challenging phenomena. %Discovery and investigation of emergent phenomena in quantum materials benefit from high quality samples. 



\subsection*{Research questions}
\noindent


% These four material families span a broad range of electronic energy scales, from the low Kelvin regime in high pressure CeSb$_2$ to thousands of Kelvin in Bi, Sb and Ba, with YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ %($\sim \SI{400}{\kelvin}$) 
% and CeNi$_2$Ge$_2$  %($\sim \SI{100}{\kelvin}$) 
% connecting the two extremes. Nevertheless, they share striking similarities, such as tunability by pressure or composition and proximity to magnetic or structural instabilities. 
% Above their superconducting transitions, they all exhibit anomalous `normal' states with a sub-quadratic temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity, signalling low-lying excitations. In Bi-III (\autoref{fig:Materials}d), this non-Fermi liquid form of the resistivity may be attributed to low-lying sliding \ul{phonon} modes, which are a built-in consequence of its quasiperiodic structure. %This illustrates the central role of soft modes for causing anomalous electronic transport properties and also for understanding strong-coupling superconductivity. 
% By contrast, \ul{magnetic} excitations that become long-lived and long-range near the threshold of magnetism likely play the dominant role in the other three material families. 

%Exploiting these contrasts and similarities, 
Studying the wide family of U-based unconventional superconductors will address the following \myul{key research questions}  about superconducting quantum materials:

\paragraph {a) Superconducting state:} what is the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter? What causes high critical fields, in particular if they far exceed the paramagnetic limit? %as in high-pressure CeSb$_2$? 
What is the origin of residual $C/T$ in the low $T$ limit in many samples of unconventional superconductors such as UTe$_2$, and can this be quantitatively attributed to impurity bound states? 
Can we explain not only why some materials superconduct but also why other, very similar materials do not? What factors determine the variation of $T_c$ within the same material family? 

%Superconducting properties will be investigated in multi-probe studies with a wide range of collaborating groups (see below), in some cases in combination with applied pressure.

\paragraph{b) Anomalous `normal' state:} % out of which the superconductivity emerges:
can we understand quantitatively the high electronic heat capacity and enhanced quasiparticle mass in U-based heavy fermion compounds, which typically exceeds density functional theory (DFT) values by at least an order of magnitude? A breakdown of the standard model of condensed matter physics, Fermi liquid theory, can be signalled by a sub-quadratic temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity $\rho(T)$ at low temperature. 
%Such anomalous forms of the resistivity have been observed in many materials, including cuprates, iron based superconductors such as YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ and other transition metal compounds, heavy fermion compounds, but also in 
%Similar phenomena can also be attributed to low-lying phonon modes, for instance 
%the high-pressure structure of Bi and the quasi-skutterudite Ca$_3$Ir$_4$Sn$_{13}$ near a structural qcp \citesel{klintberg12}. 
Understanding this wide-spread phenomenon  (e.g. \autoref{fig:Materials}, but also other heavy fermion and transition metal compounds such as the cuprates), which often coincides with unconventional or strong-coupling superconductivity, is a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. 
Are signatures of Fermi liquid breakdown confined to the immediate vicinity of quantum critical points?
% or can they extend over regions in parameter space? 
Can they be understood quantitatively in terms of observable low-energy excitations, or soft modes -- charge, orbital, nematic, magnetic or vibrational? How do they relate to \myul{Planckian dissipation} (e.g. \cite{bruin13,hartnoll15}) as a universal ceiling on scattering rate? 
%We will investigate signatures of Fermi liquid breakdown in transport, magnetic or thermodynamic properties or even in quantum oscillation measurements and track them with applied field, composition and pressure. 

\paragraph{c) Nature and tunability of effective interaction:} superconducting and normal state properties are controlled by the effective interaction between charge carriers, or quasiparticles. In contrast to the bare Coulomb interaction, the effective interaction can be dynamic, it can couple to spin, and it can be tuned by varying underlying material parameters. In many currently known unconventional superconductors, the interaction is predominantly magnetic \cite{monthoux07}, but different mechanisms are possible. These might involve density, valence, quadrupolar or orbital degrees of freedom, individually or in combination. How does the form of the effective interaction connect to microscopic models such as the Hubbard model for correlated metals near Mott localisation, the Kondo lattice model for 4$f$-electron heavy fermion superconductors, or the Hund's metal in some of the Fe-based superconductors \cite{georges13}? 
%In the latter,  the electrons in the far more extended Fe $d$-states, which are forced into a high spin state, introduce strong local correlations that may be seen as analogous to Kondo lattice physics. Is this conceptual connection between rare-earth based heavy fermion compounds and the newer Fe-based superconductors helpful in understanding both material families?
%Can the Kondo energy be tuned to zero in special cases, as proposed in scenarios of orbitally selective Mott transitions or Kondo breakdown (e.g. \cite{si01,paul07}), and what are the consequences of ultra-low Kondo scales for superconducting and normal state properties? %What is the relationship between the underlying crystalline, electronic and magnetic structure and the form of the effective quasiparticle interaction? 
Can we understand and control the energy scales that enter these microscopic models,  and can we exploit their tunability to vary superconducting and normal state properties? 
%At a microscopic level, rare-earth based, so-called heavy fermion superconductors are often discussed in a Kondo-lattice model in terms of the interplay between electrons in extended $s$, $p$ and $d$-states, which form broad metallic energy bands, and more localised electrons in tightly confined $f$-states, which take on properties of local magnetic moments at high temperatures or high energies. 
%A crucial parameter in this picture is the Kondo energy scale, which sets an effective bandwidth in the low temperature limit.
%How can aspects of the effective interaction be varied, for instance by changing composition or pressure, to affect normal state properties, the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ or critical fields?   

More ideas: \\
\begin{itemize}
  \item Most early hf superconductors were U-based. Maybe because it's actually wide-spread in U compounds? 

\item $C/T$ is intermediate between heavy d-metal compounds (e.g. KFe2As2, YFe2Ge2) and Ce-compounds

\item
Local vs. band, orbitally selective Mott transitions? What is the number of itinerant f electrons? 
Age-old problem of e.g. UPt3 QO

\item 
On-site correlations, Hund's metal 
How do we actually pick that up experimentally?

\item
Role of Spin-orbit coupling?

\item 
FM qcp -> 1st order or SDW or something else altogether (URu2Si2). 
Lessons from NbFe2, PrPtAl

\item 
What determines Bc2, and what can we learn from it? 
And are there ways to maximise Bc2?

\item 
Are there vortex state transitions?
Maybe lessons to be learned for applications

\item 
Multicomponent order parameters
How do we identify them? How are they manipulated? How can we find new materials that host them?

\item 
Fermi surface instabilities
Central e.g. to UGe2 story. Maybe happens more generally?!

\item Nature of hidden order states, as in URu$_2$Si$_2$

\subsection*{Selected materials}
\noindent
% Driven by this overarching objective, 
For these reasons, our project will initially investigate three material systems available as \myul{high-quality single crystals}, in which discoveries and enabling breakthroughs %in crystal growth and high pressure techniques 
have occurred as recently as last summer (\autoref{fig:Materials}):
%Recent discoveries and advances in crystal growth and high pressure techniques enable a broad study across four material systems, which 
%The chosen materials display common phenomena but access a wide range of electronic or vibrational energy scales  (\autoref{fig:Materials}):
%the new \uline{iron-based superconductors} YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ and LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$, the \uline{moderate heavy-fermion superconductors} CeNi$_2$Ge$_2$ and CePd$_2$Si$_2$, the \uline{ultra-heavy fermion superconductor} CeSb$_2$ and the \uline{quasiperiodic superconductors} high pressure  Bi, Sb and Ba.
%We will investigate four superconducting material systems  

\paragraph {a) UTe$_2$:} 
%including the new system YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ and its relative LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$, which straddle an antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition and exhibit  an unusually high heat capacity $C$ at low temperature $T$ ($C/T \simeq 100~\text{mJ/molK}^2$), consistent with our observation of carrier mass renormalisation among the highest recorded in transition metal compounds \citesel{baglo21}. 
% Whereas LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$ is antiferromagnetic below about $\SI{6}{\kelvin}$, its isoelectronic sister compound YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ is paramagnetic. 
using a new generation of ultra-clean crystals grown using the molten salt flux technique by project partners at Charles University, Prague, we were able to detect quantum oscillations with unprecedented clarity, enabling us to resolve the Fermi surface structure of UTe$_2$ \cite{eaton23}. These high quality crystals with residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of order 500 display a significantly enhanced $T_c$ compared to previous generations of samples. Because disorder is always relevant in unconventional superconductors, many initial findings in UTe$_2$, starting with the observation of residual Sommerfeld ratio $C/T$ within the superconducting state, need to be re-examined in these new crystals. We have already found that the superconducting critical fields are significantly enhanced, whereas the metamagnetic transition remains unchanged \cite{wu23}. With at least three distinct superconducting states reported in UTe$_2$ in a complex field/pressure/temperature phase diagram, these new, cleaner crystals offer the opportunity to clarify many of the open scientific questions surrounding this interesting but complex material.

% $T^{3/2}$ power-law dependence of the resistivity. 
% %The non-Fermi liquid $T^{3/2}$ form of the electrical resistivity, the pronounced effect of disorder scattering on superconductivity \cite{chen19} and theoretical studies \cite{singh14,subedi14} indicate that YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ is an unconventional superconductor. 
% More recently, we also found superconductivity in the newest generation of high purity crystals of LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$ (\autoref{fig:Materials}a). 
% These findings depended on our ability to produce ultra-high quality crystals of both materials, with purity levels in YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ exceeding those of the best samples grown outside Cambridge tenfold \citesel{chen20b}. %This new generation of crystals will enable wide-ranging multi-probe studies in both materials as well as non-superconducting reference compounds, which will be outlined below.

\subsection*{Programme and Methodology}
\noindent
The research programme capitalises on our recent breakthroughs in the material systems listed above. %, namely the discovery of superconductivity in YFe$_2$Ge$_2$, high-pressure CeSb$_2$ and LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$ and advances in crystal growth and high pressure techniques. %It is imperative to capitalise on these discoveries via a wider spectrum of measurement techniques. 
%In three work packages, it combines in-house experiments, joint projects with external partners, and materials growth and discovery.
%expertise and facilities in high pressure, low temperature, high field measurements and crystal growth with specialised expertise and facilities of external expert partners to enable multi-probe studies that together have the power to resolve the questions listed above. 

They exploit our expertise and facilities in high precision transport, magnetic and thermodynamic measurements under extreme conditions of hydrostatic pressure (piston-cylinder and anvil cell devices, reaching up to $\SI{>100}{\kilo\bar}$), magnetic field (up to $\SI{20.4}{\tesla}$) and low temperature (down to $\SI{<0.03}{\kelvin}$ in this project). We will continue to refine and extend experimental methods, with particular emphasis on high pressure temperature modulation calorimetry and quantum oscillation measurements  \citesel{friedemann16,semeniuk22}. %In-house studies will focus on:



% (ii) what mechanism could
%explain the $T^{3/2}$ form of the electrical
%resistivity, which deviates from the Fermi-liquid
%\emph{T}\textsuperscript{2} dependence, 
%similar to the situation in
%(K/Rb/Cs)Fe$_2$As$_2$, 
%(iv) why, in summary,
%are the bulk properties of YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ so
%similar to many of those of (K/Rb/Cs)Fe$_2$As$_2$ , %(e.g. \autoref{fig:HCYFGKFACompare}),
%despite the fact that the Fermi surface geometry of
%YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ is much more isotropic (3D) than
%the very anisotropic (2D) Fermi surface sheets in
%(K/Rb/Cs)Fe$_2$As$_2$? % (\autoref{FermiSurface})?

\paragraph{Spectroscopic} studies using neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, muon spin rotation or X-ray magnetic circular dichroism to probe magnetic or superconducting ground state properties. These largely facilities-based experiments will be complemented by laboratory-based studies such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy (St. Andrews) and penetration-depth measurements using the tunnel-diode oscillator technique (Edinburgh, with Bristol).

\paragraph{Superconducting states:}
% combining a wide range of specialised experimental techniques (listed above)  will help resolve the gap structures in YFe$_2$Ge$_2$, LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$, CeNi$_2$Ge$_2$ and high-pressure CeSb$_2$. 
Analysis will incorporate the role of impurity bound states, which for a sign-changing gap produce distinct signatures in  all low $T$ properties, by numerical studies as in \cite{bang17} and by varying the impurity level.

%in many correlated electron systems, superconductivity and non-Fermi liquid transport properties are closely
%connected to the threshold of magnetism, also called a magnetic quantum
%phase transition, or -- if the transition is second order -- a quantum
%critical point. 
%YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ does not order magnetically, but could there be magnetic order close by, and would this
%be associated with the magnetic fluctuations observed in neutron
%scattering? LuFe\textsubscript{2}Ge\textsubscript{2}
%displays spin-density wave order below $9~\text{K}$. Replacing lutetium with yttrium \cite{ran11} suppresses this further, indicating a \ul{quantum phase transition}  at intermediate composition, where
%\emph{T\textsubscript{c}} would be expected to peak, if the effects of disorder scattering could be ignored. Hydrostatic pressure offers an additional tuning parameter. 
the power of mapping out magnetic field, pressure and composition phase diagrams is illustrated in \autoref{fig:Guiding}. The recent example of UTe$_2$ demonstrates that unexpected twists such as the ultra-high field superconductivity, resilient up to \SI{60}{\tesla} for a narrow range of field orientations, could easily be missed without careful examination of a material's phase diagram over wide parameter ranges. 
% We will examine the role of magnetic quantum phase transitions by joint pressure and composition tuning within the space spanned 
We will use transport (electrical resistivity, Hall effect), thermodynamic (heat capacity), magnetic (magnetisation, muSR) and structural (XRD, ultrasound) techniques at applied pressure and in applied fields to survey phase diagrams and clarify outstanding questions in the comparatively new superconductors UTe$_2$ and UAu$_2$.

% Joint projects with expert project partners have been arranged (see also letters of support), and in most cases  work has already begun. 



\paragraph{Electronic excitations:} key input for any
theoretical description derives from the observation of quantum oscillations in high magnetic fields, a precise signature of the electronic Fermi surface and
carrier mass. Ambient pressure and high pressure quantum oscillation surveys will be carried out on all four materials systems.
Studies on the Cambridge 20.4 Tesla/dilution refrigerator cryomagnet will be augmented by measurements up to 37 Tesla at the HFML Nijmegen facility. Complementary information is provided by Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy using the quasiparticle interference technique and by  ARPES.

%In YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ and CeNi$_2$Ge$_2$, we
%have already observed 
%de Haas-van Alphen quantum
%oscillations, . 
%The fact that quantum oscillations could be observed despite non-Fermi liquid signatures in resistivity data presents a paradox which invites closer examination. 
%In YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ \citesel{baglo21}, LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$ and CeNi$_2$Ge$_2$, we have already observed de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillations, extending to fields as low as $\SI{3}{\tesla}$ in the latest generation of YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ crystals (\autoref{fig:Highlights}). With further optimisation, quantum oscillations can be tracked to even lower fields, opening up the rare opportunity to investigate a range in which transport measurements suggest non-Fermi liquid behaviour (above). 
%High pressure quantum oscillation surveys will also be used to investigate the unusual normal state properties in CeSb$_2$ and in quasiperiodic materials.

%Without aspiring to an accurate description of unconventional superconductivity, this computational filter will boost the search success rate by combining ab initio calculations of the electronic structure with phenomenological models for the magnetic fluctuation spectrum to examine trends for magnetically mediated superconductivity within Eliashberg theory, as outlined  in \cite{monthoux07}.  

%Further to these, we will build on our earlier study of the influence of disorder scattering on superconductivity \citesel{chen19} by tracking the

\paragraph{Non Fermi liquid signatures} will be examined using high-precision thermodynamic and transport measurements across pressure, magnetic field and temperature in all four material systems, in order to pin down the regions in the phase diagram where they extend to lowest temperature and correlate them with quantum critical phenomena arising from nearby ordered states. The role of disorder will be examined in samples of varying purity levels. %Of central importance is the precise determination of anomalous power-law exponents in the form of $\rho(T)$. 
%All the materials presented in \autoref{fig:Materials} display a low temperature $\rho(T)$ that violate the standard Fermi liquid form. 
In YFe$_2$Ge$_2$, $\rho(T)$ takes a non-Fermi liquid form at low $T$, but the observed strong quantum oscillations are interpreted in terms of Fermi liquid quasiparticles \cite{baglo21}. %, suggesting that  applies, at least in high magnetic fields. 
This presents a paradox which invites closer examination using transport measurements and quantum oscillation experiments at low applied fields (see also below).
The absolute scale of the electrical resistivity will be compared to expectations from the hypothesis of Planckian Dissipation, which assumes that scattering rates are limited to a universal ceiling of $k_B T/\hbar$ in strongly correlated materials.

%The discoveries summarised in \autoref{fig:Materials} build on our group's recent progress in high-purity crystal growth and high pressure techniques. In this work package, we will employ and refine these techniques and conduct systematic searches for new superconducting quantum materials. 
%\paragraph{New ultra-pure crystals generate new opportunities.}
Crystal quality plays a central role in the discovery of new collective phenomena in quantum materials. %, in particular in unconventional superconductors.
%Initial studies of the superconducting properties of YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ revealed the importance of achieving long electronic mean free paths. 
% Bulk superconductivity was only observed in YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ after \myul{systematic improvements} in sample quality \citesel{chen16,chen19}, culmi\-nating in the introduction of a new growth method \citesel{chen20b}. %which introduced horizontal flux-growth. 
% The resulting crystals
% exhibit a residual resistivity ratio %$RRR$, a key quality indicator,
%  \myul{$RRR\simeq 650$}, an order of magnitude higher than the best values
% reported outside Cambridge. The same approach can be used for growing superior single crystals of \myul {CeNi$_2$Ge}$_2$. Preliminary tests have produced samples with $RRR >100$, exceeding the quality of the best previously grown CeNi$_2$Ge$_2$ crystals by at least a factor of five and clean enough to allow us, for the first time, to observe quantum oscillations in this key material. % as part of an exploratory first experiment. 
% %This new generation of crystals finally opens the door for a comprehensive programme to  resolve the superconducting gap structure and investigate the strongly correlated normal state of YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ and isoelectronic and isostructural LuFe$_2$Ge$_2$. 
% %, within the wider context of iron based superconductors in particular and correlated electron unconventional superconductivity more generally.


\paragraph{Crystal growth:} UTe$_2$, UAu$_2$ and UGe$_2$ will be grown using our carefully optimised .. .   We will further improve our growth protocols ... 

%The growth programme will widen to include other Fe-based intermetallics such as LaFe$_2$Ge$_2$, YFe$_2$Si$_2$, and CaFe$_2$Ge$_2$ as well as their composition series with YFe$_2$Ge$_2$. 
\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent 
We will widen our  programme
\begin{leftlist}
\item to other well-known U-based heavy fermion superconductors such as UPt$_3$ and URu$_2$Si$_2$. With recent advances in instrumentation a re-examination of the superconducting and magnetic states in the former is becoming timely. Little is known, moreover, regarding its evolution with pressure and strain. In the latter, which hosts an enigmatic hidden order state below about \SI{17}{\kelvin} at ambient pressure, quantum oscillation measurements to higher magnetic fields than were possible in the past will reveal much-needed information about Fermi surface geometry and carrier mass. 
%Ce-based Kondo-lattice systems such as CePd$_2$Si$_2$ (\autoref{fig:Guiding}), the ferromagnet CeAgSb$_2$ \cite{logg13}, of which we have recently grown crystals with $RRR>180$ and the antiferromagnet CeAl$_2$.
%Both CeAgSb$_2$  and CeAl$_2$ have critical pressures of about $\SI{35}{\kilo\bar}$, now well within the range of our high pressure measurements.
 %We will continue to improve this technique by using higher quality starting materials, by tuning the growth protocol and by optimising the annealing procedure. 
\item to related U-based systems such as U$_6$Fe or ... %Fe-based intermetallics such as LaFe$_2$Ge$_2$, YFe$_2$Si$_2$, and CaFe$_2$Ge$_2$ as well as their composition series with YFe$_2$Ge$_2$, and 
\item to 
 $d-$metal compounds that may mimic some of the properties of the U-based superconductors which form the central objective of this project.
 % of current interest, including the high pressure superconductor MnP \cite{cheng15} and the Kagom\'e lattice  superconductors (K/Rb/Cs)V$_3$Sb$_5$ \cite{ortiz21}, which have already been grown in our lab, as well as the ruthenate high pressure superconductor Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ \cite{alireza10}. %\hl{note also Nowotny phase work}

induction melting, and we will
explore Czochralski and Bridgman growth for single crystal production. We will continue to improve these techniques by using higher quality starting materials, by tuning the growth protocol and by optimising the annealing procedure.  


\paragraph {Sample characterisation} will involve powder and
single-crystal x-ray diffraction as well as electron microprobe analysis,
and the determination of magnetic, thermodynamic and transport
properties using our dedicated
SQUID magnetometer and PPMS (both with $^3$He inserts).  
As part of WP2, more detailed investigation of the nature of disorder and impurities will be carried out in collaboration with ... using high resolution single crystal x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy.
d. Characterisation: transport/thermodynamic/magnetic; XRD; TEM


\paragraph{Materials discovery:}
we will follow up fresh opportunities in targeted searches for altogether new unconventional superconductors. %Systematic studies on the material systems already at the centre of the proposal will inspire targeted searches: 
% For instance, can we expect to hit a quantum critical point in high pressure studies of YFe$_2$Si$_2$ or LaFe$_2$Ge$_2$, mentioned above? Can we extend insights from Fe-based systems to Mn, Ni, Co or Ru-based materials? Can we find relatives to high-pressure CeSb$_2$? 
\myul{Pressure-assisted high throughput surveys} play a central role in these searches, as in previous discoveries (e.g. Figs.~\ref{fig:Materials}b-d). % by leveraging the power of computation.
Further acceleration is possible  by more accurate selection of candidate materials, for which we will increasingly complement heuristic filters by numerical calculations with collaborators (see also WP2).  


%Further to seeking out materials with nearby magnetic order, other filter criteria could be (i) moderately enhanced low temperature heat capacity, (ii) high room temperature resistivity, (iii) layered structure, and (iv) potential for making pure samples.

\subsection*{Plan of work, management,
risks}
\noindent
The experimental, theoretical and computational expertise of numerous UK and international partners complements our strengths in materials growth, exploration and discovery as well as high pressure, high magnetic field measurements. 
%generate new insights into the origins of superconductivity and non-Fermi liquid states 
%that will assist the search for new superconducting material families, ultimately with superior properties for practical applications.
%in Fe-based materials, moderate and ultra-heavy Kondo-lattice materials and quasiperiodic host-guest structures.

% and related transition metal
%compounds more generally, 
%We also expect new insights on the origin of the wide variation of $T_c$ within material families such as the iron-based superconductors. 
%These insights will assist the search for entirely new superconductors, ultimately with superior properties for practical applications. % such as elevated $T_c$, critical field, improved metallurgy or simply lower manufacturing cost.

%Resolving these questions in YFe$_2$Ge$_2$ may furthermore shed new light on Ce-based superconductors such as CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, which have recently come under renewed scrutiny \cite{yamashita17} \hl{(link to next two sections)}.

\paragraph{Plan of work:} the attached chart outlines the project schedule, which is organised along the three work packages 
%(WP 1) in-house measurements (Grosche, Sutherland, Worasaran, Alireza), (WP 2) collaborative measurements  (Chen, Grosche) with associated theory (Chubukov) and numerical studies (Monserrat, Pickard), and (WP 3) crystal growth and materials discovery (Chen). Analysis and interpretation accompanying these activities will be coordinated by Grosche and Lonzarich.  We will schedule in-house measurements according to urgency and sample availability. We will start with CeSb$_2$ and  high pressure Sb-II, to be followed by the iron-based superconductors, then CeNi$_2$Ge$_2$/CePd$_2$Si$_2$, and then materials requiring higher pressures, such as Ba-IV or Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Collaborative measurements follow the scheduling of our project partners, some of whom have already initiated exploratory studies.

\paragraph{Management:} 
%Responsibilities within the core team are clearly separated, as listed above. 
%the core team is located in the same laboratory. %its work can be coordinated by weekly group meetings. 
Selection of materials, contingency planning and new
opportunities will be decided during weekly group meetings or,
in case of urgency, at additional impromptu meetings.  Collaborative
work with multiple project partners can carry on in parallel and will
be coordinated via long-distance communications. 
%Some projects, in particular cuprate crystal growth, require visits to Cambridge by Bristol collaborators, whereas others 
Visits to collaborating groups will be
prepared by the investigators concerned and finalised in the weekly 
meetings.

\paragraph{Risks and rewards:} we have carefully considered the risks and
rewards of our ambitious proposal and conclude that they are
adequately balanced. Risks are mitigated by (i) the spread of
projects, which range from immediately achievable to extremely
challenging, (ii) our combined experience over many years of research
and the state-of-the-art capabilities of our facilities, (iii) the large
and expanding pool of materials that can be investigated, (iv) the
great diversity of quantum phenomena of theoretical and practical
interest that are expected to arise beyond those discussed above.

\subsection*{National importance}
\paragraph{Societal and economic impact:}
the superhydride discoveries show that the technological benefits of superconductivity are not fundamentally limited to low temperatures. 
New superconducting materials with superior properties, be it transition temperature,
critical magnetic field, metallurgy or cost, 
can unlock transformative impact, often with particular relevance to sustainability or health: 
(i) powerful magnets already used in MRI scanners, % (a multi-billion pound market \cite{stfc16}), 
\myul{fusion}  (ITER), and accelerators (LHC), requiring  thousands of tons of high critical field superconducting wire; 
(ii) lightweight generators already used in wind turbines and motors/generators now examined for use in airplanes;   
(iii) radio-frequency and microwave devices such as exceedingly sharp, low-noise filters for base stations of radio communications systems; 
(iv) ultra-fast, ultra-low-power electronics with applications in communications and computing, where traditional electronics is reaching its performance limits; 
(v) solid-state based quantum computing such as Google's ``quantum supremacy" breakthrough.

%In this project, we investigate the fundamental science underlying unconventional superconductivity in Fe and Cu based materials. 
The project will prepare the ground for a systematic exploration of new unconventional superconductors, and likely serendipitous discoveries carry the potential for entirely unanticipated new technologies. 
% Supporting our research plan places the UK at the heart
%of innovation in the field.
%Successful UK high technology enterprises such as Oxford
%Instruments, Cryogenic, IceOxford have the size, expertise and
%customer-base to implement advances in refrigeration technology. 
Further impact arises from the advanced training our graduate students and PDRAs receive in condensed matter physics and methodology. This
work contributes to the UK effort in a key scientific area and feeds new materials and techniques as well as skilled problem-solvers and
entrepreneurs into our emerging network of high technology instrument
makers.


\paragraph{Academic beneficiaries:}
This project contributes to the \uline{strong UK research in quantum materials}. It connects with work on cuprate and iron-based superconductors in \myul{Bristol and Oxford}, uranium-based superconductors and high pressure research in \myul{Edinburgh}, non-centrosymmetric superconductors, organic superconductors and topological materials in \myul{Warwick}, ruthenates and other 2D materials in \myul{St. Andrews} and \myul{Birmingham}, and Yb-based superconductors at \myul{RHUL}, with theory work at \ul{Bristol, Oxford, Kent, Loughborough, Birmingham, KCL, RHUL, UCL and Cambridge}, and with numerous other quantum materials research initiatives throughout the UK.   
%The UK condensed matter research community, in which the proposed research is embedded, is vibrant and successful. 
%To maintain a leading position within
%a very strong international field, and 
Motivated by  
the high scientific and economic impact of quantum materials research, leading industrial nations have
invested heavily in this field, notably the USA, China, Japan and the
other large European countries. 
To ensure that the UK 
can benefit from any breakthroughs and know-how arising, we must push
forward with ambitious research programmes which leverage existing
strengths. The project falls within the EPSRC research areas {\em Condensed matter: electronic structure} and  {\em magnetism and magnetic materials} as well as {\em Superconductivity}, and within the EPSRC themes {\em Physical Sciences}  and {\em Energy}. It is relevant to the Physics Grand Challenges {\em Emergence and physics far from equilibrium} and 
{\em Quantum physics for new quantum technologies.} 
%Bristol (Carrington, Hussey, Hayden, Friedemann, Annett) and Oxford  (A. Coldea, R. Coldea, Boothroyd), uranium-based superconductors in Edinburgh (Huxley), non-centrosymmetric superconductors, organic superconductors and topological materials in Warwick (Balakrishnan, Lees, Goddard, Petrenko), as well as theory work at Kent (Quintanilla), Loughborough (Betouras), Birmingham (Schofield), KCL (Bhaseen), RHUL ( and UCL (Green)

%The diversity of electronic states in quantum materials, their reach into practicable temperature regions and their tunability can lead to new technologies. 
%Foremost among these is superconductivity, a macroscopic quantum phenomenon with multiple applications: 
%The recent discovery of superconductivity near room temperature in high pressure LaH10 demonstrates that cryogenic temperatures are not a fundamental prerequisite for superconductivity, if materials with sufficiently strong attractive electronic interactions can be identified. 
%For next-generation superconducting magnet technology -- needed, for instance, in MRI magnets, highly efficient generators and particle accelerators -- cuprate superconductors offer step improvements in peak field and operating temperature, whereas  Fe-based superconductors may have the advantage in terms of manufacturing cost. 

%Can other technologically relevant parameters be likewise improved, given the right materials?
