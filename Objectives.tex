By comparing and contrasting results from these four systems, our  programme will examine key research questions regarding 
\begin{leftlist} 
\item 
the structure of the superconducting order parameter and the origin of high critical fields, 
\item 
the origin of anomalous normal state properties which signal breakdown of the standard model of condensed matter physics, Fermi liquid theory, and their link with the emerging notion of Planckian dissipation \cite{bruin13,hartnoll15}, and
\item 
the nature and tunability of effective interactions underlying normal and superconducting state properties.
\end{leftlist}
