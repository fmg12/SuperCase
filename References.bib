  abstract = {Recent observations of selective emergence (suppression) of superconductivity in the uncollapsed (collapsed) tetragonal phase of LaFe\$\_2\$As\$\_2\$ has rekindled interest in understanding what features of the band structure control the superconducting T\$\_c\$. We show that the proximity of the narrow Fe-d\$\_\{xy\}\$ state to the Fermi energy emerges as the primary factor. In the uncollapsed phase this state is at the Fermi energy, and is most strongly correlated and source of enhanced scattering in both single and two particle channels. The resulting intense and broad low energy spin fluctuations suppress magnetic ordering and simultaneously provide glue for Cooper pair formation. In the collapsed tetragonal phase, the d\$\_\{xy\}\$ state is driven far below the Fermi energy, which suppresses the low-energy scattering and blocks superconductivity. A similar source of broad spin excitation appears in uncollapsed and collapsed phases of CaFe\$\_\{2\}\$As\$\_\{2\}\$. This suggests controlling coherence provides a way to engineer T\$\_c\$ in unconventional superconductors primarily mediated through spin fluctuations.},

  abstract = {We have grown RFe2Ge2 single crystals for R=Y and ten members of the lanthanide series (Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd\textendash Tm, Lu) using Sn flux as the solvent. The method yields clean, high quality crystal plates as evidenced by residual resistivities and RRR values in the range of 3\textendash 12 mO cm and 20\textendash 90, respectively. The crystals are also virtually free of magnetic impurities or secondary phases, allowing the study of the intrinsic anisotropic magnetic behavior of each compound. Characterization was made with X-Ray diffraction, and temperature and field-dependent magnetization, specific heat and resistivity. Very strong anisotropies arising mostly from CEF effects were observed for all magnetic rare earths except Gd. Antiferromagnetic ordering occurred at temperatures between 16.5 K (Nd) and 1.1 K (Ho) that roughly scale with the de Gennes factor for the heavy rare earths. For some members there is also a lower temperature transition associated with changes in the magnetic structure. Tm did not order down to 0.4 K, and appears to be a van Vleck paramagnet. All members which ordered above 2 K showed a metamagnetic transition at 2 K for fields below 70 kOe. The calculated effective moments per rare earth atom are close to the expected free ion values of R3\th{} except for Sm which displays anomalous behavior in the paramagnetic state. The non-magnetic members of this series (Y, Lu) are characterized by an unusually large electronic specific heat coefficient (gB60 mJ=mol K2) and temperature-independent susceptibility term (w0B0:003 emu=mol), indicative of a relatively large density of states at the Fermi surface.},

  abstract = {Although the pairing mechanism of Fe-based superconductors (FeSCs) has not yet been settled with consensus with regard to the pairing symmetry and the superconducting (SC) gap function, the vast majority of experiments support the existence of spin-singlet signchanging s-wave SC gaps on multi-bands (s{$\pm$}-wave state). This multi-band s{$\pm$}-wave state is a very unique gap state per se and displays numerous unexpected novel SC properties, such as a strong reduction of the coherence peak, non-trivial impurity effects, nodal-gap-like nuclear magnetic resonance signals, various Volovik effects in the specific heat (SH) and thermal conductivity, and anomalous scaling behaviors with a SH jump and condensation energy versus Tc, etc. In particular, many of these non-trivial SC properties can easily be mistaken as evidence for a nodal-gap state such as a d-wave gap. In this review, we provide detailed explanations of the theoretical principles for the various non-trivial SC properties of the s{$\pm$}-wave pairing state, and then critically compare the theoretical predictions with experiments on FeSCs. This will provide a pedagogical overview of to what extent we can coherently understand the wide range of different experiments on FeSCs within the s{$\pm$}-wave gap model.},

Here, we summarize recent studies on the Fe-chalcogenides, with the goal to address some unresolved questions such as what is the influence of chemical stoichiometry on the phase diagram, what is the exact parent phase of FeSe system, and why can Tcs be so dramatically enhanced in FeSe based superconductors? Recent developments in novel synthesis to prepare chalcogenide crystals, nanomaterials and thin films allow the community to begin to address these issues. Then we review physical properties of the Fe chalcogenides, specifically focusing on optical properties, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) results. These measurements along with recent theories provide a framework for better understanding the origin of superconductivity in FeSe and Fe-chalcogenides.},

The variety of different pairing states raises the issue of whether the physics of FeSCs is model dependent or is universal, governed by a single underlying pairing mechanism. I argue that the physics is universal and that all pairing states obtained so far can be understood within the same universal pairing scenario and are well described by the effective low-energy model with small numbers of input parameters.},

  abstract = {The highest critical temperature of superconductivity Tc has been achieved in cuprates: 133 K at ambient pressure and 164 K at high pressures. As the nature of superconductivity in these materials is still not disclosed, the prospects for a higher Tc are not clear. In contrast the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory gives a clear guide for achieving high Tc: it should be a favorable combination of high frequency phonons, strong coupling between electrons and phonons, and high density of states. These conditions can be fulfilled for metallic hydrogen and covalent hydrogen dominant compounds. Numerous followed calculations supported this idea and predicted Tc=100-235 K for many hydrides but only moderate Tc\textasciitilde 17 K has been observed experimentally. Here we found that sulfur hydride transforms at P\textasciitilde 90 GPa to metal and superconductor with Tc increasing with pressure to 150 K at \textasciitilde 200 GPa. This is in general agreement with recent calculations of Tc\textasciitilde 80 K for H2S. Moreover we found superconductivity with Tc\textasciitilde 190 K in a H2S sample pressurized to P{$>$}150 GPa at T{$>$}220 K. This superconductivity likely associates with the dissociation of H2S, and formation of SHn (n{$>$}2) hydrides. We proved occurrence of superconductivity by the drop of the resistivity at least 50 times lower than the copper resistivity, the decrease of Tc with magnetic field, and the strong isotope shift of Tc in D2S which evidences a major role of phonons in the superconductivity. H2S is a substance with a moderate content of hydrogen therefore high Tc can be expected in a wide range of hydrogen-contain materials. Hydrogen atoms seem to be essential to provide the high frequency modes in the phonon spectrum and the strong electron-phonon coupling.},

  abstract = {The discovery of superconductivity at 203 K in H3S brought attention back to conventional superconductors whose properties can be described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and the Migdal-Eliashberg theories. These theories predict that high, and even room temperature superconductivity (RTSC) is possible in metals possessing certain favorable parameters such as lattice vibrations at high frequencies. However, these general theories do not suffice to predict real superconductors. New superconducting materials can be predicted now with the aid of first principles calculations based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). In particular, the calculations suggested a new family of hydrides possessing a clathrate structure, where the host atom (Ca, Y, La) is at the center of the cage formed by hydrogen atoms. For LaH10 and YH10 superconductivity, with critical temperatures Tc ranging between 240 and 320 K is predicted at megabar pressures. Here, we report superconductivity with a record Tc \textasciitilde{} 250 K within the Fm-3m structure of LaH10 at a pressure P \textasciitilde{} 170 GPa. We proved the existence of superconductivity at 250 K through the observation of zero-resistance, isotope effect, and the decrease of Tc under an external magnetic field, which suggests an upper critical magnetic field of 120 T at zero-temperature. The pressure dependence of the transition temperatures Tc (P) has a maximum of 250-252 K at the pressure of about 170 GPa. This leap, by \textasciitilde{} 50 K, from the previous Tc record of 203 K indicates the real possibility of achieving RTSC (that is at 273 K) in the near future at high pressures and the perspective of conventional superconductivity at ambient pressure.},

  abstract = {High-pressure resistivity measurements (up to 18.8 kbar) indicate that YFe2Si2 is not superconducting (SC) down to 1.2 K. On the other hand, a clear magnetic peak is observed at 232 K. This peak was recently proposed to a new nearly ferromagnetic Fermi-liquid (NFFL) state. By chemical substitutions of magnetic Ho ions in the nonmagnetic Y site and/or C or Ge in the Si sites of YFe2Si2, we show that this peak is affected and shifted to lower temperatures by three factors: (i) lattice parameters caused by chemical substitution, (ii) applied magnetic field, and (iii) disorder induced by substitution in the Si sites. While Ho substitution does not change much the peak position, both isovalent C and Ge substitutions shift the peak to lower temperature, e.g., in YFe2SiGe the peak position drops to 11 K, indicating that the dominant factor is the disorder induced in the Si site. None of investigated materials is SC down to 1.8 K. Apparently, in all compounds studied, the Fe ions are nonmagnetic, and it is assumed that all magnetic peaks reported here represent this new NFFL state previously proposed for YFe2Si2.},

The underlying reasons of the electron spectrum instability may be either Fermi surface nesting or the existence of Van Hove saddle points for lower dimensionalities. CDW superconductors include layered dichalcogenides, NbSe3, and compounds with the A15 and C15 structures among others. There is much evidence to show that high-Tc oxides may also belong to this group of materials. The SDW superconductors include URu2Si2 and related heavy-fermion compounds, Cr\textendash Re alloys and organic superconductors. We review the experimental evidence for CDW and SDW instabilities in a wide range of different superconductors, and assess the competition between these instabilities of the Fermi surface and the superconducting gap. Issues concerning the superconducting order parameter symmetry are also touched upon. The accent is put on establishing a universal framework for further theoretical discussions and experimental investigations based on an extensive list of available and up-to-date references.},

The results match the predicted cubic metallic phase of LaH10 having cages of thirty-two hydrogen atoms surrounding each La atom. Upon decompression, the fcc-based structure undergoes a rhombohedral distortion of the La sublattice. The superhydride phases consist of an atomic hydrogen sublattice with H\`AH distances of about 1.1 , which are close to predictions for solid atomic metallic hydrogen at these pressures. With stability below 200 GPa, the superhydride is thus the closest analogue to solid atomic metallic hydrogen yet to be synthesized and characterized.},

  abstract = {Strong electronic correlations are often associated with the proximity of a Mott-insulating state. In recent years however, it has become increasingly clear that the Hund's rule coupling (intra-atomic exchange) is responsible for strong correlations in multiorbital metallic materials that are not close to a Mott insulator. Hund's coupling has two effects: It influences the energetics of the Mott gap and strongly suppresses the coherence scale for the formation of a Fermi liquid. A global picture has emerged recently, which emphasizes the importance of the average occupancy of the shell as a control parameter. The most dramatic effects occur away from half-filling or single occupancy. We review the theoretical understanding and physical properties of these Hund's metals, together with the relevance of this concept to transition-metal oxides (TMOs) of the 3d, and especially 4d, series (such as ruthenates), as well as to the iron-based superconductors (iron pnictides and chalcogenides).},

The analysis of the intensity dependence on the crystal orientation with respect to both the direction of the microwave field and the static magnetic field revealed remarkable features: the intensity variation with respect to the direction of the microwave field was found to be one order of magnitude smaller than expected from the g-factor anisotropy. Furthermore, we observed a weak basal plane anisotropy of the ESR parameters which we interpret to be an intrinsic sample property.},

Broad anomalies in C(T ) suggest short range magnetic ordering at about 250 mK and 180 mK for YbPt2Sn and YbPt2In, respectively. The weak exchange and the low ordering temperature result in a large magnetocaloric effect as deduced from the magnetic field dependence of C(T ), making these compounds interesting candidates for magnetic cooling.

  abstract = {A new class of high-temperature superconductors based on iron and arsenic was recently discovered (Kamihara et al 2008 J. Am. Chem. Soc. 130 3296), with the superconducting transition temperature as high as 55 K (Ren et al 2008 Chin. Phys. Lett. 25 2215). Here we show, using microscopic theory, that the normal state of the iron pnictides at high temperatures is highly anomalous, displaying a very enhanced magnetic susceptibility and a linear temperature dependence of the resistivity. Below a coherence scale T {${_\ast}$}, the resistivity sharply drops and susceptibility crosses over to Pauli-like temperature dependence. Remarkably, the coherence\textendash incoherence crossover temperature is a very strong function of the strength of Hund's rule coupling JHund. On the basis of the normal state properties, we estimate JHund to be {$\sim$}0.35 eV. In the atomic limit, this value of JHund leads to the critical ratio of the exchange constants J1/J2 {$\sim$} 2. While normal state incoherence is common to all strongly correlated superconductors, the mechanism for emergence of the incoherent state in iron oxypnictides is unique due to its multiorbital electronic structure.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity at temperatures up to 190 K at high pressures has recently been observed in H2S and interpreted as conventional BCS-electron\textendash phonon-driven superconductivity (Drozdov et al., 2014). Instead we propose that it is another example of the mechanism of hole superconductivity at work. Within this mechanism high temperature superconductivity arises when holes conduct through negatively charged anions in close proximity. We propose that electron transfer from H to S leads to conduction by holes in a nearly full band arising from direct overlap of S{$\frac{1}{4}$} p orbitals in a planar structure. The superconductivity is non-phononic and is driven by pairing of heavily dressed hole carriers to lower their kinetic energy. Possible explanations for the observed lower critical temperature of D2S are discussed. We predict that high temperature superconductivity will also be found in other sulfides under high pressure such as Li2S; Na2S and K2S.},

RRR values vary between 35 and 65 with, on average, no systematic change in \$T\_c\$ value, indicating that systematic changes in RRR do not lead to comparable changes in \$T\_c\$. Specific heat measurements on samples that showed clear resistive signatures of a superconducting transition did not show any signature of a superconducting phase transition, which suggests that the superconductivity observed in this compound is either some sort of filamentary, strain stabilized superconductivity associated with small amounts of stressed YFe\$\_2\$Ge\$\_2\$ (perhaps at twin boundaries or dislocations) or is a second crystallographic phase present at levels below detection capability of conventional powder x-ray techniques.},

Although having its biggest impact for more applied materials like batteries, there is increasing interest in applying these ideas to predict new superconductors. This is obviously a challenge, given that superconductivity is a many body phenomenon, with whole classes of known superconductors lacking a quantitative theory. Given this caveat, various efforts to formulate materials design principles for superconductors are reviewed here, with a focus on surveying the periodic table in an attempt to identify cuprate analogues.},

Physical measurements indicated that BCS-like superconductivity is observed only in YPt2Si2 (Tc\,\,=\,\,1.54\,K) and YPd2Si2 (Tc\,\,=\,\,0.43\,K), while no superconducting phase transition was found in other systems at least down to 0.35\,K.

The derived Fermi surface size and topology complement earlier angle-dependent magnetoresistance studies and confirm the existence of a large quasi-cylindrical hole-doped Fermi surface with a small, but finite, c-axis warping. An accurate determination of the hole concentration reveals that superconductivity in Tl2Ba2CuO6+{$\delta$} does not follow the universal Tc( p) parabola for cuprate families and survives up to a larger doping of pc = 0.31. The observation of quantum oscillations for both dopings demonstrates that Fermi liquid behaviour is not confined to the edge of the superconducting dome, but is robust up to at least 0.3Tcmax. Moreover, the observation of such well-resolved oscillations implies that the physical properties of overdoped Tl2Ba2CuO6+{$\delta$} are determined by a single, spatially homogeneous electronic ground state. Finally, analysis of the different quasiparticle masses points towards a purely magnetic or electronic pairing mechanism.},

However, for detailed quantitative understanding, the nature of the high-pressure environment acting on the sample must be well de ned, a requirement often not met. Since HTS are quasi-2D, all properties are anisotropic. As a result, only a combination of fully hydrostatic and uniaxial pressure experiments are capable of providing the detailed information required. Unfortunately, very few such experiments have been carried out. For both Cu-oxide and Fe-based HTS at optimal doping, Wf is found to be enhanced by either increasing the separation of the superconducting planes or decreasing their area. Future experiments will extend such hydrostatic/uniaxial studies over the entire doping range.},

The HTS cable was successfully commissioned on April 22, 2008. In 2007, a new DOE Superconductor Power Equipment program to address outstanding issues for integrating HTS cables into utility grids was awarded to the current project team. The goal of the follow up project is to develop and install a replacement cable phase manufactured using second generation superconducting wire. In addition outstanding components development necessary for full scale integration of HTS cables into power grids are addressed This paper will report on the status of the two projects including the results of further developments and the operating experience gained during 3 years of in grid operation of a transmission voltage superconducting cable.},

  abstract = {Metal-insulator transitions in clean, crystalline solids can be driven by two distinct mechanisms. In a conventional insulator, the charge carrier concentration vanishes, when an energy gap separates filled and unfilled electronic states. In the established picture of a Mott insulator, by contrast, electronic interactions cause coherent charge carriers to slow down and eventually stop in electronic grid-lock without materially affecting the carrier concentration itself. This description has so far escaped experimental verification by quantum oscillation measurements, which directly probe the velocity distribution of the coherent charge carriers. By extending this technique to high pressure we were able to examine the evolution of carrier concentration and velocity in the strongly correlated metallic state of the clean, crystalline material NiS\$\_2\$, while tuning the system towards the Mott insulating phase. Our results confirm that pronounced electronic slowing down indeed governs the approach to the insulating state. However, the critical point itself, at which the carrier velocity would reach zero and the effective carrier mass diverge, is concealed by the insulating sector of the phase diagram. In the resulting, more nuanced view of Mott localisation, the inaccessibility of the low temperature Mott critical point resembles that of the threshold of magnetic order in clean metallic systems, where criticality is almost universally interrupted by first order transitions, tricritical behaviour or novel emergent phases such as unconventional superconductivity.},

  abstract = {Whether a quantum critical point (QCP) lies beneath the superconducting dome has been a long-standing issue that remains unresolved in many classes of unconventional superconductors, notably cuprates, heavy fermions, and, most recently, iron pnictides. The existence of a QCP may offer a route to understanding the origin of unconventional superconductors' anomalous non-Fermi liquid properties, the microscopic coexistence between unconventional superconductivity and magnetic or some other exotic order, and, ultimately, the mechanism of superconductivity itself. The isovalent substituted iron pnictide BaFe2(As1\`AxPx)2 offers a new platform for the study of quantum criticality, providing a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the electronic properties in a wide range of the phase diagram. Recent experiments in BaFe2(As1\`AxPx)2 have provided the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a second-order quantum phase transition lying beneath the superconducting dome.},

Experimental techniques producing ultrahigh pressure as well as measuring electrical resistance, magnetization and optical response are developed especially for studying the pressure-induced superconductivity of simple systems such as elemental materials. The details of these techniques are described in \textsection 1. In \textsection 2, we review several examples of pressure-induced superconductivity observed for the first time by our group. Comparisons between experimental results and theories based on the first principles band calculations are given in \textsection 3.

Although the main emphasis is on the oscillations themselves and their many peculiarities, rather than on the theory of the electronic structure they reveal, sufficient examples are given in detail to illustrate the kind of information that has been obtained and how this information agrees with theoretical prediction.},

  abstract = {Periodic table of elements starts with hydrogen, a simplest element of all. The simplicity is lost when the element is compressed to high densities or participates in a chemical bonding in compounds, being subjected to ``chemical pressure'' of surrounding atoms or molecules. The chemical nature of hydrogen is dictated by its simplest electronic shell, which has only one electron. Hydrogen can donate this electron and behave like alkali metal, or accept an extra electron and form a hydride ion with closed shell resembling a group VII element. The complexity of hydrogen goes beyond these simplest configurations, when hydrogen is involved in a multicenter bonding or in hydrogen bonds. This complex behavior is tightly related to the ability of hydrogen to participate in the process of electronic transport in solids and potentially be able to contribute to the superconductivity in a material. Hydrogen by itself when compressed to immense pressures of 400\textendash 500 GPa may form a simple atomic phase with very high critical superconducting temperatures (Tc) well above room temperature. While this theoretical insight awaits confirmation at pressures at the limit of current experimental capabilities, a variety of other hydrogen-rich materials have been suggested recently to have record high Tc values. The very existence of many of these materials still lacks experimental confirmation. In this review article, we will present an extensive list of such predicted materials. We will also review superconductivity in classical hydrides (mostly metal hydrides) and current theoretical understanding of relatively low Tc`s in metal hydrides of transition and noble metals.},

  abstract = {It is shown that the elastic compliance of a crystal mount, coupled with the sinusoidal nature of the de Haas \textendash{} van Alphen torque versus magnetic field and angle, causes nonlinearities in the measured oscillations. The equations are formally the same as those describing the magnetic interaction in the de Haas \textendash{} van Alphen effect. Hysteresis effects can result from the torque effects. Measurements of the torque de Haas \textendash{} van Alphen oscillations in arsenic are in quantitative agreement with theory and the measured angular compliance of the torque magnetometer. Other effects of a compliant crystal mount are also discussed. The relative strengths of the torque effect and magnetic interaction are compared, and it is indicated by calculations for typical crystal mounts that torque effects may dominate unless care is taken to ensure a rigid sample mount.}

  abstract = {An introduction is given to collective modes in layered, high Tc superconductors. An experimental demonstration is treated of the mechanism proposed by Anderson whereby photons travelling inside the superconductor become massive, when the U(1) gauge symmetry is broken in the superconductor to which the photons are coupled. Using the Ferrell-Tinkham sumrule the photon mass is shown to have a simple relation to the spectral weight of the condensate. Various forms of Josephson plasmons can exist in single-layer, and bi-layecuprates. In the bi-layer cuprates a transverse optical plasma mode can be observed as a peak in the c-axis optical conductivity. This mode appears as a consequence of the existence of two different intrinsic Josephson couplings between the CuO2 layers. It is strongly related to a collective oscillation corresponding to small fluctuations of the relative phases of the two condensates, which has been predicted in 1966 by A.J. Leggett for superconductors with two bands of charge carriers. A description is given of optical data of the high Tc cuprates demonstrating the presence of these and similar collective modes.},

In the nonmagnetic state, the density of states at the Fermi level are mostly derived from the dxy, dyz, and dzx orbits, just like the Fepnictide superconductors. The band structure and Fermi surfaces exhibit significantly three dimensional character. Our calculations indicate that the ground state of LaFe2Ge2 and LaFe2Si2 is the stripe antiferromagnetic configuration in the a-b plane and stacked antiparallel along the c-axis direction. The overestimate magnetic tendency within calculation indicates these systems nearness to a magnetic quantum critical point (QCP).},

In this article, we review the current understanding of superconductivity in heavyfermion compounds and identify a set of characteristics that is common to their unconventional superconducting states. These core properties are compared with those of other classes of unconventional superconductors such as the cuprates and iron-based superconductors. We conclude by speculating on the prospects for future research in this field and how new advances might contribute towards resolving the long-standing mystery of how unconventional superconductivity works.},

Like the iron pnictides, YFe\$\_2\$Ge\$\_2\$ displays anisotropic stripe-type antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations at (\$\textbackslash pi\$, \$0\$, \$\textbackslash pi\$). More interesting, however, is the observation of strong spin fluctuations at the in-plane ferromagnetic wavevector (\$0\$, \$0\$, \$\textbackslash pi\$). These ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are isotropic in the (\$H\$, \$K\$) plane, whose intensity exceeds that of stripe spin fluctuations. Both the ferromagnetic and stripe spin fluctuations remain gapless down to the lowest measured energies. Our results naturally explain the absence of magnetic order in YFe\$\_2\$Ge\$\_2\$ and also imply that the ferromagnetic correlations may be a key ingredient for iron-based materials.},
